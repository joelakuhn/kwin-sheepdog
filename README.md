# KWin Sheepdog

Adds Keyboard shortcuts to save and load the current window layout. Layouts are not persistent. They only allow you to bounce back and forth to different layouts within the same session. When restoring a layout, windows loaded after the layout was saved will be stacked below the saved windows.

## Installation

Clone the repository, and `./install-and-enable.sh`.
